# Ping Analytics
Ping analytics is a project to analyze my ping to a server, and compare it against the time of day in different parts of the united states

# Backend - Python 3
The backend is writen in python 3, with a sqlite database to store the data.

I run the ping command from whatever OS its on, (windows, linux, etc.) and then parse that down to get just the ping in milliseconds. 

# Frontent - Express
The frontent is a node.js express server, which has an authentication system in there for good measure from Auth0. 

The frontent reads the sqlite .db file, and displays it for right now, in a text box on screen. Eventually this will be turned into a table.

# Contact

if you see this and want to give me sugestions, I am open to hear them.
